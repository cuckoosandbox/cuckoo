`Cuckoo Sandbox <https://cuckoosandbox.org/>`_ is the leading open source

What does that mean? It simply means that you can throw any suspicious file at
it and in a matter of seconds Cuckoo will provide you back some detailed
results outlining what such file did when executed inside an isolated
environment.
