In three words, [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) is a malware analysis system.

What does that mean? It simply means that you can throw any suspicious file at it and in a matter of seconds Cuckoo will provide you back some detailed results outlining what such file did when executed inside an isolated environment.
