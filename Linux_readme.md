In my bachelor thesis I developed a prototype that can be used for comprehensive **static and dynamic Linux malware analysis**. As this prototype is based on the [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org), it is used to automatically run and analyze files inside an isolated Linux operating system and collect several analysis results that outline the malware bevavior. Furthermore, since I adapted and expanded the source code of Cuckoo Sandbox v1.1 the prototype is **capable of running both Linux and Windows malware analysis tasks**.

#### What I've done so far:
* Development of modules that run dynamic analyses:
  * SyscallTracer: Run, control and observe malware
  * FilesystemTracer: Observe filesystem activities using kernel modules
  * ResultLogger: Collect analysis results and directly send them to the host (For this, I adapted the reporting and communication protocols that were already implemented for Windows malware analysis)
* Expansion of existing modules that run static analyses:
  * Implemented static analysis of ELF files
* Several smaller changes:
  * Webinterface (the user can choose between linux and windows analysis)
  * Reporting module (formatting and output things)
  * Linux analyzer module (to make my modules run and communicate properly)
  * Created a netlog module (according to cuckoomon) for host-guest result transmission using a linux guest 
  * And even more (this will be updated soon)
* Code update to the latest version of Cuckoo Sandbox

set password for cuckoo@localhost = password('**********');
grant all on cuckoo.* to cuckoo@localhost;
```

##### Guest
* Enable guest virtualization on host
* Install guest virtual machine

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential ssh -y
sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-setuptools python-pip -y
