# Specify which VirtualBox mode you want to run your machines on.
# Can be "gui", "sdl" or "headless". Refer to VirtualBox's official
# documentation to understand the differences.
mode = gui

# VirtualBox Web Service URL
url = https://127.0.0.1:18083

# Unix credentials of the user on a VirtualBox host,
# who has imported virtual machines to use with a Cuckoo Sandbox
user = username_goes_here

# VirtualBox host directory shared with a Cuckoo Sandbox
remote_storage = /tmp/cuckoostorage

# Specify a comma-separated list of available machines to be used. For each
# specified ID you have to define a dedicated section containing the details
# on the respective machine. (E.g. cuckoo1,cuckoo2,cuckoo3)
machines = cuckoo1,cuckoo2,cuckoo3,cuckoo4,cuckoo5

[cuckoo1]
# Specify the label name of the current machine as specified in your
# VirtualBox configuration.
label = cuckoo1

# Specify the operating system platform used by current machine
# [windows/darwin/linux].
platform = windows

# Specify the IP address of the current virtual machine. Make sure that the
# IP address is valid and that the host machine is able to reach it. If not,
# the analysis will fail.
ip = 192.168.56.101

# (Optional) Specify the snapshot name to use. If you do not specify a snapshot
# name, the VirtualBox MachineManager will use the current snapshot.
# Example (Snapshot1 is the snapshot name):
# snapshot = Snapshot1

# (Optional) Specify the name of the network interface that should be used
# when dumping network traffic from this machine with tcpdump. If specified,
# overrides the default interface specified in cuckoo.conf
# Example (vboxnet0 is the interface name):
# interface = vboxnet0

# (Optional) Specify the IP of the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in cuckoo.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here 
# the IP address for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify an
# address here, the machine will use the default value from cuckoo.conf.
# NOTE: if you set this option you have to set result server IP to 0.0.0.0 in cuckoo.conf.
# Example:
# resultserver_ip = 192.168.56.1

# (Optional) Specify the port for the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in cuckoo.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
# the port for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify a port
# here, the machine will use the default value from cuckoo.conf.
# Example:
# resultserver_port = 2042

# (Optional) Set your own tags. These are comma separated and help to identify
# specific VMs. You can run samples on VMs with tag you require.
# tags = windows_xp_sp3,32_bit,acrobat_reader_6
