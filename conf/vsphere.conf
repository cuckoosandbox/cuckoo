# Specify the IP address of the current virtual machine. Make sure that the
# IP address is valid and that the host machine is able to reach it. If not,
# the analysis will fail.

# (Optional) Specify the name of the network interface that should be used
# when dumping network traffic from this machine with tcpdump. If specified,
# overrides the default interface specified in auxiliary.conf
# Example (eth0 is the interface name):
# interface = eth0

# (Optional) Specify the IP of the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in cuckoo.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
# the IP address for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify an
# address here, the machine will use the default value from cuckoo.conf.
# NOTE: if you set this option you have to set result server IP to 0.0.0.0 in cuckoo.conf.
# Example:
# resultserver_ip = 192.168.122.101

# (Optional) Specify the port for the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in cuckoo.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
# the port for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify a port
# here, the machine will use the default value from cuckoo.conf.
# Example:
# resultserver_port = 2042

# (Optional) Set your own tags. These are comma separated and help to identify
# specific VMs. You can run samples on VMs with tag you require.
# Note that the 64_bit tag is currently special.  For submitted 64-bit PE files,
# the 64_bit tag will automatically be added, forcing them to be run on a 64-bit
# VM.  For this reason, make sure all 64-bit VMs have the 64_bit tag.
