[routing]
# Default network routing mode; "none", "internet", or "vpn_name".
# In none mode we don't do any special routing - the VM doesn't have any
# network access (this has been the default actually for quite a while).
# In internet mode by default all the VMs will be routed through the network
# interface configured below (the "dirty line").
# And in VPN mode by default the VMs will be routed through the VPN identified
# by the given name of the VPN (as per vpn.conf).
# Note that just like enabling VPN configuration setting this option to
# anything other than "none" requires one to run utils/rooter.py as root next
# to the Cuckoo instance (as it's required for setting up the routing).
route = none

# Network interface that allows a VM to connect to the entire internet, the
# "dirty line" so to say. Note that, just like with the VPNs, this will allow
# malicious traffic through your network. So think twice before enabling it.
# (For example, to route all VMs through eth0 by default: "internet = eth0").
internet = none

# To route traffic through multiple network interfaces Cuckoo uses 
# Policy Routing with separate routing table for each output interface
# (VPN or "dirty line"). If this option is enabled Cuckoo on start will try 
# to automatically initialise routing tables by copying routing entries from 
# main routing table to the new routing tables. Depending on your network/vpn 
# configuration this might not be sufficient. In such case you would need to 
# initialise routing tables manually. Note that enabling this option won't
# affect main routing table.
auto_rt = yes

# Routing table name/id for "dirty line" interface. If "dirty line" is
# also default gateway in the system you can leave "main" value. Otherwise add
# new routing table by adding "<id> <name>" line to /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# (e.g., "200 eth0"). ID and name must be unique across the system (refer to
