The documentation for installing, using and customizing Cuckoo Sandbox is
available under different forms and formats.

Under "docs/book/" you can find the complete Cuckoo Sandbox Book in three
different formats:
    * HTML
    * PDF
    * Text

Under "docs/books/src" you'll find the Sphinx sources used to build the book.

Under "epydoc/" you'll find the Python documentation of Cuckoo's libs and apis
generated by Epydoc. This directory contains two sub-directories: "host" and
"guest", containing references for Cuckoo's Host and Guest components
respectively.
