When Cuckoo receives an analysis request, you'll see something like
this:

      [2011-12-18 18:20:16,242] [Core.Dispatcher] INFO: Acquired analysis task for target "/tmp/malware.exe".
      [2011-12-18 18:20:16,424] (Task #1) [Core.Analysis.Run] INFO: Acquired virtual machine "cuckoo1".
      [2011-12-18 18:20:17,005] [VirtualMachine.Restore] INFO: Virtual machine "Cuckoo1" successfully restored to current snapshot.

      [2011-12-18 18:20:56,308] (Task #1) [Core.Analysis.FreeVM] INFO: Virtual machine "cuckoo1" released.
      [2011-12-18 18:20:56,309] (Task #1) [Core.Analysis.Run] INFO: Analyis completed.

Let's get through what happened.

At line **1** Cuckoo's tasks dispatcher acquired a new submission for
the target */tmp/malware.exe*. At line **2** it acquired the free
virtual machine *cuckoo1*. At line **3** Cuckoo restored the virtual
machine to current snapshot and at line **4** it started it in
graphical mode.

In the meanwhile it prepared all required files and configurations for
the analysis.

At line **5** Cuckoo analyzer component started inside the virtualized
Windows environment with process ID *1732*. At line **6**, after the
60 seconds of the specified timeout, the analyzer terminates its
execution and exits. At line **7** the analysis results are stored to
*analysis/1/* and this same path is specified to the processor script
which is invoked at line **8** with process ID *8571*. At line **9**
the virtual machine is successfully powered off and released at line
**10**. At line **11** finally Cuckoo considers the analysis as
completed.

At this point you should have complete analysis results into
*analysis/1/* and, depending on the options you enabled in
*reporting.conf* (*Configuration*), some automatically generated
reports at *analysis/1/reports/*.
