Auxiliary Modules
=================

**Auxiliary** modules define some procedures that need to be executed in parallel
to every single analysis process. All auxiliary modules should be placed under
the ``cuckoo/cuckoo/auxiliary/`` directory, that way the module will fall
under the ``cuckoo.auxiliary`` module.

The skeleton of a module would look something like this:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from cuckoo.common.abstracts import Auxiliary

    class MyAuxiliary(Auxiliary):

        def start(self):
            # Do something.

        def stop(self):
            # Stop the execution.

The function ``start()`` will be executed before starting the analysis machine
and effectively executing the submitted malicious file, while the ``stop()``
function will be launched at the very end of the analysis process, before
launching the processing and reporting procedures.

For example, an auxiliary module provided by default in Cuckoo is called
``sniffer.py`` and takes care of executing **tcpdump** in order to dump the
generated network traffic.
