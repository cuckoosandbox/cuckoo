Preparing the Guest (Physical Machine)
======================================

.. warning::
    This chapter only applies for a Physical Machine setup! For normal Cuckoo
    usage please ignore it.

At this point you should have configured the Cuckoo host component and you
should have designed and defined the number and the names of the physical
machines you are going to use for malware execution.

Now it's time to create such machines and to configure them properly.
