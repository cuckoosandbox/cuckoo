Cloning the Virtual Machine
===========================

In case you planned to use more than one virtual machine, there's no need to
repeat all the steps done so far: you can clone it. In this way you'll have
a copy of the original virtualized Windows with all requirements already
installed.

The new virtual machine will also contain all the settings of the original one,
which is not good. Now you need to proceed repeating the steps explained in
:doc:`network`, :doc:`agent` and :doc:`saving` for this new machine.
