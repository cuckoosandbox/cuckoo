# specified ID you have to define a dedicated section containing the details
# on the respective machine. (E.g. cuckoo1,cuckoo2,cuckoo3)

# (Optional) Specify the snapshot name to use. If you do not specify a snapshot
# name, the VirtualBox MachineManager will use the current snapshot.
# Example (Snapshot1 is the snapshot name):

# (Optional) Specify the name of the network interface that should be used
# when dumping network traffic from this machine with tcpdump. If specified,
# overrides the default interface specified in auxiliary.conf
# Example (vboxnet0 is the interface name):

# (Optional) Specify the IP of the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in cuckoo.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
# the IP address for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify an
# address here, the machine will use the default value from cuckoo.conf.
# NOTE: if you set this option you have to set result server IP to 0.0.0.0 in cuckoo.conf.
# Example:
resultserver_ip = 

# (Optional) Specify the port for the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in cuckoo.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here

# specific VMs. You can run samples on VMs with tag you require.

# and properly determining which profile to use.

# services one can specify the "noagent" option so Cuckoo will just wait until
# the end of the analysis instead of trying to connect to the non-existing
# Cuckoo Agent. We can't really intercept any inter-VM communication from the
# host / gateway so in order to dump traffic between VMs we have to use a
# different network dumping approach. For this machine we use the "nictrace"
# functionality from VirtualBox (which is basically their internal tcpdump)
# and thus properly dumps inter-VM traffic.
