Join the discussion
===================

You can get in contact with the Cuckoo developers and users through the `Community`_
portal or on IRC at the official `#cuckoosandbox`_ channel.

If you are encountering an issue you can't solve and are looking for some help,
go to our `Community`_ website.

Please read the following rules before posting:

 * Before posting, read the `Community`_ archives, the Cuckoo blog,
   the documentation and Google about your issue. **DO NOT** post questions that
   have already been answered over and over everywhere.
 * Posting messages saying just something like "Doesn't work, help me" are completely
   useless. If something is not working report the error, paste the logs,
   the config file, the information on the virtual machine, the
   results of the troubleshooting, etc. Give context. We are not wizards and we
   don't have a crystal ball.
 * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me", "Error" are not
   proper titles.
