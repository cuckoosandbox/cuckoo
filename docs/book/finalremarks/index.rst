Join the discussion
===================

If you are encountering an issue you can't solve and are looking for some
help, go to our `Discussion`_ page and pick a platform of your choice. This is
where you can get in contact with the Cuckoo Developers and users (our
preference go to the Slack & IRC).

Please read the following rules before posting:

 * Before posting, read our `Github issue tracker`_, the Cuckoo blog,
   the documentation and Google about your issue. **DO NOT** post questions
   that have already been answered over and over everywhere.
 * Posting messages saying just something like "Doesn't work, help me" are
   completely useless. If something is not working report the error, paste the
   logs, the configuration files, the information on the virtual machine, the
   results of the troubleshooting, etc. Give context. We are not wizards and
   we don't have a crystal ball.
 * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me", "Error" are not
   proper titles.
