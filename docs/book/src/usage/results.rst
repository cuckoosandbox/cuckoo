Analysis Results
================

Once an analysis is completed, several files are stored in a dedicated directory.
Unless you configured differently, all of the analysis are saved into
*analysis/* with a subdirectory named after the numerical ID assigned to the
analysis into the database.

Following is an example of analysis results::

    .
    |-- additional
    |-- analysis.conf
    |-- analysis.log
    |-- dump.pcap
    |-- files
    |   |-- dropped.tmp
    |   `-- dropped.exe
    |-- logs
    |   |-- 1232.csv
    |   |-- 1540.csv
    |   `-- 1118.csv
    |-- reports
    |   |-- report.html
    |   |-- report.json
    |   `-- report.txt
    |-- malware.exe
    `-- shots
        |-- shot_001.jpg
        |-- shot_002.jpg
        |-- shot_003.jpg
        `-- shot_004.jpg

analysis.conf
=============

*analysis.conf* is a configuration file automatically generated by Cuckoo to
specify some parameters to the guest component (analyzer).
It's generally not relevant for an end-users as it's exclusively used internally
by Cuckoo.

analysis.log
============

*analysis.log* is a log file generated by Cuckoo analyzer and that keeps
track of analysis execution and might report errors occurred during the
analysis.

dump.pcap
=========

*dump.pcap* is the trace dump containing all the network activity generated by
the virtual machine during the malware execution.

additional/
===========

The *additional/* directory can be used to drop any kind of additional file or
data which is not generated by the malware. For example memory dumps, dumped
configs or anything else you might want to store during an analysis.

files/
======

The *files/* directory contains all files created or deleted by the malware and
that were successfully dumped by Cuckoo.

logs/
=====

The *logs/* directory contains the raw CSV-like logs generated by the monitored
processes and that contains the concrete behavioral tracing results.

reports/
========

The *reports/* directory contains the abstract analysis reports generated
automatically by Cuckoo. The number and the format of such reports depends on
the the configuration explained in the :doc:`../installation/host/configuration`
chapter.

shots/
======

The *shots/* directory contains the screenshots of Windows desktop taken during
the analysis execution.
