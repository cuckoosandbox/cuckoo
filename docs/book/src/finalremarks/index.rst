Join the discussion
===================

You can get in contact with Cuckoo's developers and users through the `official
mailing list`_ kindly provided by `The Honeynet Project`_ or on IRC at the
official `#cuckoobox`_ channel.

Mailing list how to
-------------------

Cuckoo's `official mailing list`_ require registration, so you have to register
your email address before sending mails. Please make sure you registered with
the email address you're trying to post with.

Please respect netiquette when posting, in detail:

 * Before  posting read the mailing list archives, read the Cuckoo blog, read
   the documentation and Google about your issue. Stop posting questions that
   have already been answered over and over everywhere.
 * Posting emails saying just like "Doesn't work, help me" are completely
   useless. If something is not working report the error, paste the logs, paste
   the config file, paste the information on the virtual machine, paste the
   results of the troubleshooting, give context. We are not wizards and we
   don't have the crystal ball.
 * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me", "Error" is not a
   proper title.
 * Tend to use `pastebin.com`_ or `pastie.org`_ and similar services to paste
   logs and configs: make the email more readable.
 * Tend to upload your attachment to file upload services, we have a very
   low attachment size limit.
 * Tend to not write HTML emails.
