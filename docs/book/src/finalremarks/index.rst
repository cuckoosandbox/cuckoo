Join the discussion
===================

You can get in contact with the Cuckoo developers and users through the `official
mailing list`_ kindly provided by `The Honeynet Project`_ or on IRC at the
official `#cuckoosandbox`_ channel.

Our mailing list is mostly intended for development discussions and sharing
of ideas and bug reports.
If you are encountering an issue you can't solve and are looking for some help,
go to our `Community`_ website.

Please read the following rules before posting:

 * Before posting, read the mailing list archives, the Cuckoo blog,
   the documentation and Google about your issue. **DO NOT** post questions that
   have already been answered over and over everywhere.
 * Posting messages saying just something like "Doesn't work, help me" are completely
   useless. If something is not working report the error, paste the logs,
   the config file, the information on the virtual machine, the
   results of the troubleshooting, etc. Give context. We are not wizards and we
   don't have a crystal ball.
 * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me", "Error" are not
   proper titles.
 * Try to use `pastebin.com`_, `pastie.org`_ or similar services to paste
   logs and configs: makes the message more readable.
 * **The community website uses Markdown syntax**. So please read the `Markdown`_
   documentation before posting.
