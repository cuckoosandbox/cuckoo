Join the discussion
===================

You can get in contact with Cuckoo's developers and users through the `official
mailing list`_ kindly provided by `The Honeynet Project`_ or on IRC at the
official `#cuckoosandbox`_ channel.

Our mailing list is mostly intended for development discussions and sharing
of ideas and bug reports.
If you are encountering an issue you can't solve and are looking for some help,
go to our `Community`_ website.

Please read the following rules before posting:

 * Before posting read the mailing list archives, read the Cuckoo blog, read
   the documentation and Google about your issue. Stop posting questions that
   have already been answered over and over everywhere.
 * Posting messages saying just like "Doesn't work, help me" are completely
   useless. If something is not working report the error, paste the logs, paste
   the config file, paste the information on the virtual machine, paste the
   results of the troubleshooting, give context. We are not wizards and we
   don't have the crystal ball.
 * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me", "Error" is not a
   proper title.
 * Tend to use `pastebin.com`_ or `pastie.org`_ and similar services to paste
   logs and configs: make the message more readable.
 * **The community website uses Markdown syntax**. So please read `Markdown`_
   documentation before posting.
