Cloning the Virtual Machine
===========================

In case you planned to use more than one virtual machine, there's no need to
repeat all the steps done so far: you can clone it. In this way you'll have
a copy of the original virtualized Windows with all requirements already
installed.

The new virtual machine will eventually bring along also the settings of the
original one, which is not good. Now you need to proceed repeating the steps
explained in :doc:`network`, :doc:`shares` and :doc:`saving` for this new
machine.
