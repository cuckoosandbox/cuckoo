Installation
============

This chapter explains how to install Cuckoo.

Although the recommended setup is *GNU/Linux* (Debian or Ubuntu preferably)
Cuckoo has proved to work smoothly also on *Mac OS X* as host; the recommended
and tested setup for guests are *Windows 7* for Windows analysis, *Mac OS X
Yosemite* for Mac OS X analysis and Debian for Linux Analysis, although Cuckoo
should work with other releases of guest os.

.. note::

    This documentation refers to *Host* as the underlying operating systems on
    which you are running Cuckoo (generally being a GNU/Linux distribution) and
    to *Guest* as the Windows virtual machine used to run the isolated analysis.
