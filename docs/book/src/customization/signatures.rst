Signatures
==========

With Cuckoo you're able to create some customized signatures that you can run against
the analysis results in order to identify some predefined pattern that might
represent a particular malicious behavior or an indicator you're interested in.

These signatures are very useful to give a context to the analyses: both because they
simplify the interpretation of the results as well as for automatically identifying
malwares of interest.

Some examples of what you can use Cuckoo's signatures for:
    * Identify a particular malware family you're interested in by isolating some unique behaviors (like file names or mutexes).
    * Spot interesting modifications the malware performs on the system, such as installation of device drivers.
    * Identify particular malware categories, such as Banking Trojans or Ransomware by isolating typical actions commonly performed by those.

You can find signatures created by us and by other Cuckoo users on our `Community`_ repository.

Getting started
===============

Creation of signatures is a very simple process and requires just a decent
understanding of Python programming.

First things first, all signatures must be located inside *modules/signatures/*.

The following is a basic example signature:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class CreatesExe(Signature):
            name = "creates_exe"
            description = "Creates a Windows executable on the filesystem"
            severity = 2
            categories = ["generic"]
            authors = ["Cuckoo Developers"]
            minimum = "0.5"

            def run(self):
                return self.check_file(pattern=".*\\.exe$",
                                       regex=True)

As you can see the structure is really simple and consistent with the other
modules. We're going to get into details later, but as you can see at line **12**
from version 0.5 Cuckoo provides some helper functions that make the process of
creating signatures much easier.

In this example we just walk through all the accessed files in the summary and check
if there is anything ending with "*.exe*": in that case it will return ``True``, meaning that
the signature matched, otherwise return ``False``.

In case the signature gets matched, a new entry in the "signatures" section will be added to
the global container as follows::

    "signatures": [
        {
            "severity": 2, 
            "description": "Creates a Windows executable on the filesystem", 
            "alert": false, 
            "references": [], 
            "data": [
                {
                    "file_name": "C:\\d.exe"
                }
            ], 
            "name": "creates_exe"
        }
    ]

We could rewrite the exact same signature by accessing the **global container**
directly:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class CreatesExe(Signature):
            name = "creates_exe"
            description = "Creates a Windows executable on the filesystem"
            severity = 2
            categories = ["generic"]
            authors = ["Cuckoo Developers"]
            minimum = "0.5"

            def run(self):
                for file_path in self.results["behavior"]["summary"]["files"]:
                    if file_path.endswith(".exe"):
                        return True

                return False

This obviously requires you to know the structure of the **global container**,
which you can observe represented in the JSON report of your analyses.

Creating your new signature
===========================

In order to make you better understand the process of creating a signature, we
are going to create a very simple one together and walk through the steps and
the available options. For this purpose, we're simply going to create a
signature that checks whether the malware analyzed opened a mutex named
"i_am_a_malware".

The first thing to do is import the dependencies, create a skeleton and define
some initial attributes. These are the ones you can currently set:

    * ``name``: an identifier for the signature.
    * ``description``: a brief description of what the signature represents.
    * ``severity``: a number identifying the severity of the events matched (generally between 1 and 3).
    * ``categories``: a list of categories that describe the type of event being matched (for example "*banker*", "*injection*" or "*anti-vm*").
    * ``families``: a list of malware family names, in case the signature specifically matches a known one.
    * ``authors``: a list of people who authored the signature.
    * ``references``: a list of references (URLs) to give context to the signature.
    * ``enable``: if set to False the signature will be skipped.
    * ``alert``: if set to True can be used to specify that the signature should be reported (perhaps by a dedicated reporting module).
    * ``minimum``: the minimum required version of Cuckoo to successfully run this signature.
    * ``maximum``: the maximum required version of Cuckoo to successfully run this signature.

In our example, we would create the following skeleton:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class BadBadMalware(Signature): # We initialize the class inheriting Signature.
            name = "badbadmalware" # We define the name of the signature
            description = "Creates a mutex known to be associated with Win32.BadBadMalware" # We provide a description
            severity = 3 # We set the severity to maximum
            categories = ["trojan"] # We add a category
            families = ["badbadmalware"] # We add the name of our fictional malware family
            authors = ["Me"] # We specify the author
            minimum = "0.5" # We specify that in order to run the signature, the user will need at least Cuckoo 0.5

        def run(self):
            return

This is a perfectly valid signature. It doesn't really do anything yet,
so now we need to define the conditions for the signature to be matched.

As we said, we want to match a particular mutex name, so we proceed as follows:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class BadBadMalware(Signature):
            name = "badbadmalware"
            description = "Creates a mutex known to be associated with Win32.BadBadMalware"
            severity = 3
            categories = ["trojan"]
            families = ["badbadmalware"]
            authors = ["Me"]
            minimum = "0.5"

        def run(self):
            return self.check_mutex("i_am_a_malware")

Simple as that, now our signature will return ``True`` whether the analyzed
malware was observed opening the specified mutex.

If you want to be more explicit and directly access the global container,
you could translate the previous signature in the following way:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class BadBadMalware(Signature):
            name = "badbadmalware"
            description = "Creates a mutex known to be associated with Win32.BadBadMalware"
            severity = 3
            categories = ["trojan"]
            families = ["badbadmalware"]
            authors = ["Me"]
            minimum = "0.5"

        def run(self):
            for mutex in self.results["behavior"]["summary"]["mutexes"]:
                if mutex == "i_am_a_malware":
                    return True

            return False

Evented Signatures
==================

Since version 1.0, Cuckoo provides a way to write more performant signatures.
In the past every signature was required to loop through the whole collection of API calls
collected during the analysis. This was necessarily causing some performance issues when such
collection would be of a large size.

Cuckoo now supports both the old model as well as what we call "evented signatures".
The main difference is that with this new format, all the signatures will be executed in parallel
and a callback function called ``on_call()`` will be invoked for each signature within one
single loop through the collection of API calls.

An example signature using this technique is the following:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class SystemMetrics(Signature):
            name = "generic_metrics"
            description = "Uses GetSystemMetrics"
            severity = 2
            categories = ["generic"]
            authors = ["Cuckoo Developers"]
            minimum = "1.0"

            # Evented signatures need to implement the "on_call" method
            evented = True

            # Evented signatures can specify filters that reduce the amount of
            # API calls that are streamed in. One can filter Process name, API
            # name/identifier and category. These should be sets for faster lookup.
            filter_processnames = set()
            filter_apinames = set(["GetSystemMetrics"])
            filter_categories = set()

            # This is a signature template. It should be used as a skeleton for
            # creating custom signatures, therefore is disabled by default.
            # The on_call function is used in "evented" signatures.
            # These use a more efficient way of processing logged API calls.
            enabled = False

            def stop(self):
                # In the stop method one can implement any cleanup code and
                #  decide one last time if this signature matches or not.
                #  Return True in case it matches.
                return False

            # This method will be called for every logged API call by the loop
            # in the RunSignatures plugin. The return value determines the "state"
            # of this signature. True means the signature matched and False means
            # it can't match anymore. Both of which stop streaming in API calls.
            # Returning None keeps the signature active and will continue.
            def on_call(self, call, process):
                # This check would in reality not be needed as we already make use
                # of filter_apinames above.
                if call["api"] == "GetSystemMetrics":
                    # Signature matched, return True.
                    return True

                # continue
                return None

The inline comments are already self-explainatory.
