Processing Modules
==================

Cuckoo's processing modules are Python scripts that let you define custom
ways to analyze the raw results generated by the sandbox and append
some information to a global container that will be later used by the
signatures and the reporting modules.

You can create as many modules as you want, as long as they follow a
predefined structure that we will present in this chapter.

Global Container
================

After an analysis is completed, Cuckoo will invoke all the processing
modules available in the *modules/processing/* directory. Any additional
module you decide to create, must be placed inside that directory.

Every module will then be initialized and executed and the data returned
will be appended in a data structure that we'll call **global container**.

This container is simply just a big Python dictionary that includes
the abstracted results produced by all the modules classified by their
identification key.

Cuckoo already provides a default set of modules which will
generate a *standard* global container. It's important for the existing
reporting modules (HTML report etc.) that these default modules are
not modified, otherwise the resulting global container structure would
change and the reporting modules wouldn't be able to recognize it and
extract the information used to build the final reports.

The currently available default processing modules are:
    * **AnalysisInfo** *(modules/processing/analysisinfo.py)* - generates some basic information on the current analysis, such as timestamps, version of Cuckoo and so on.
    * **BehaviorAnalysis** *(modules/processing/behavior.py)* - parses the raw behavioral logs and perform some initial trasnformations and interpretations, including the complete processes tracing, a behavioral summary and a process tree.
    * **Debug** *(modules/processing/debug.py)* - includes errors and the *analysis.log* generated by the analyzer.
    * **Dropped** *(modules/processing/dropped.py)* - includes information on the files dropped by the malware and dumped by Cuckoo.
    * **NetworkAnalysis** *(modules/processing/network.py)* - prases the PCAP file and extract some network information, such as DNS traffic, domains, IPs, HTTP requests, IRC and SMTP traffic.
    * **StaticAnalysis** *(modules/processing/static.py)* - performs some static analysis of PE32 files.
    * **Strings** *(modules/processing/static.py)* - extracts strings from the analyzer binary.
    * **TargetInfo** *(modules/processing/targetinfo.py)* - includes information on the analyzed file, such as hashes.
    * **VirusTotal** *(modules/processing/virustotal.py)* - lookup VirusTotal.com for AntiVirus signatures of the analyzed file. **Note**: the file is not uploaded on VirusTotal.com, if the file was not previously uploaded on the website no results will be retrieved.
    * **YaraSignatures** *(modules/processing/yarasignatures.py)* - matches the Yara signatures available under *data/yara/* against the analyzed file.

Getting started
===============

In order to make them available to Cuckoo, all processing modules are
and should be placed inside the folder at *modules/processing/*.

A basic processing module could look like:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Processing

        class MyModule(Processing):

            def run(self):
                self.key = "key"
                data = do_something()
                return data

Every processing module should contain:
    * A class inheriting ``Processing``.
    * A ``run()`` function.
    * A ``self.key`` attribute defining the name to be used as a subcontainer for the returned data.
    * A set of data (list, dictionary or string etc.) that will be appended to the global container.

You can also specify an ``order`` value, which allows you to run the available processing modules in
an ordered sequence. By default all modules are set with an ``order`` value of ``1`` and are executed
in alphabetical order.

If you want to change this value your module would look like:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Processing

        class MyModule(Processing):
            order = 2

            def run(self):
                self.key = "key"
                data = do_something()
                return data

You can also manually disable a processing module by setting the ``enabled`` attribute to ``False``:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Processing

        class MyModule(Processing):
            enabled = False

            def run(self):
                self.key = "key"
                data = do_something()
                return data

The processing modules are provided with some attributes that can be used to access the raw results
for the given analysis:

    * ``self.analysis_path``: path to the folder containing the results (e.g. *storage/analysis/1*)
    * ``self.log_path``: path to the *analysis.log* file.
    * ``self.conf_path``: path to the *analysis.conf* file.
    * ``self.file_path``: path to the analyzed file.
    * ``self.dropped_path``: path to the folder containing the dropped files.
    * ``self.logs_path``: path to the folder containing the raw behavioral logs.
    * ``self.shots_path``: path to the folder containing the screenshots.
    * ``self.pcap_path``: path to the network pcap dump.
    * ``self.memory_path``: path to the full memory dump, if created.

With these attributes you should be able to easily access all the raw results stored by Cuckoo and
perform your analytic operations on them.

As a last note, a good practice is to use the ``CuckooProcessingError`` exception
whenever the module encounters an issue you want to report to Cuckoo.
This can be done by importing the class like following:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.exceptions import CuckooProcessingError
        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Processing

        class MyModule(Processing):

            def run(self):
                self.key = "key"

                try:
                    data = do_something()
                except SomethingFailed:
                    raise CuckooProcessingError("Failed")

                return data
