            <p>
                It appears that this Virtual Machine hasn't been configured
                properly as the Cuckoo Host wasn't able to the connect to the
                Guest. There could be a few reasons for this:
                * The IP address of the VM has been configured incorrectly.
                  Please verify that the VM has a static IP address, that it
                  matches the one in the Cuckoo configuration, and that the
                  configured network routes exist.
                * Please check that there are no firewalls in-place that
                  hinder the communication between your Host and Guest.
                * If you've triple-checked the above, then please contact us.
                  Just below the errors you'll find a "Send Feedback" button.

                It appears that the environment of your Virtual Machine is
                partially unknown to us in the sense that we haven't added
                special support for it yet (for 95% of the time the analysis
                will work perfectly fine, though). By doing a special, fully
                automated, analysis you can automatically obtain the
                environment-specific Windows DLLs and other goodies that the
                Cuckoo Sandbox Core Developer team can use to add support for
                your version of Windows. In order to share this data back to
                us, please click on <a href="WIP"></a>.
